## A custom extension which allows users in a group to access all tasks in the system (tested and verified in Alfresco Process Services 1.7)

### Configuration 

* To configure this extension it is easy, all you have to do is place the aps-task-watchlist-extension-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file in webapps/activiti-app/WEB-INF/lib directory. Obviously if you are modifying it, you will need to repackage the jar!
* Create a group named "watchlist-group" and add users to the group. Users in this group will have access to all the tasks in the system.
