## An extension project containing a custom "Upload to Alfresco Content Service(ACS)" BPMN Stencil

### Configuration options of stencil.

1. ACS Relative Path: relative path with respect to -root-. You can either pre-set the value in the model or it can be resolved through expression (eg: variable)
2. Content Field Variable: If left empty, all the related content will be uploaded to the configured folder. If you require only a certain upload field's content in ACS, configure the "Field ID" in this property.

3. Configure a new endpoint named "ACS Core API" under IdentityManagement -> Tenants -> Endpoints. Example shown below ![endpoint-config](endpoint-config.png)
