## Overview
This APS EMail Solution Extension is intended to provide a functional example of how to enable inbound EMail to initiate new Process instances and complete Activities within an existing process instances.  Examples include use cases where a user may want to initiate a Request, Incident or Case Management type business process by sending an EMail.  Or another example is a use case where a task is assigned to a user, the user receives an EMail notification of the task and that user wants to respond to and complete said task via EMail.
