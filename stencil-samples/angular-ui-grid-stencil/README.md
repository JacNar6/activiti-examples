## Custom Grid/Table

A custom table stencil implementation based on [Angular UI Guid](http://ui-grid.info/docs/#/tutorial).

Note: Since APS OOTB UI use this module for the dynamic table component, the angular modules I needed to implement this feature was already part of the product.
If you need to implement stencil using one of the angular modules that is not part of the app, you will need to add the module as expalined in https://community.alfresco.com/community/bpm/blog/2017/05/01/form-stencil-examples-alfresco-process-services-aps

Please refer [Angular UI Guid Tutorial](http://ui-grid.info/docs/#/tutorial) for all the various capabilties of this component.
