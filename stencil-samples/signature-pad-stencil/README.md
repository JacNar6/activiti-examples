## Signature Pad Form Stencil Sample

A signature stencil implementation based on [Signature Pad](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad/)
Thanks to [Angular Signature](https://github.com/legalthings/angular-signature) for providing the AngularJS directive which I used in my stencil implementation. My example app, demonstrates the following:
1. Capture a signature
2. Display of a signature captured in a previous task
3. Display the signature in a document that is generated in the process.
